    <string name="s57">Then you just have to move your finger on the area to drag disks from one tower to another.</string>
    <string name="s58">Your goal is to move all the disks to the right tower.</string>
    <string name="s59">You can\'t move multiple disks at the same time.</string>

    <string name="s61">How to build big towers</string>
    <string name="s62">Training ! But to help you start, start small. To create a four level tower, you just have to create a three level tower in the middle</string>
    <string name="s63">Then, move the last disk to the right and recreate a three level tower above it. It is simple to create a five, four level tower or even more.</string>
    <string name="s64">Good luck ! Concentration is key.</string>
